The following is an older script I wrote to automate the backup of a bunch of Citrix NetScaler appliances. Previously I posted an F5 backup script; which was based on this original script. NetScalers are awesome appliances! Not only are they insanely easy to manage; their configs are very straight forward to backup and restore. Very similar to the F5 backup script, posted earlier, we rely on SSH in this script. Except here I use [SSHFS](https://github.com/libfuse/sshfs) to mount the NS:/nsconfig directory and create an archive of it. The reason why I decided to use SSHFS was originally was that I intended to grep out the configured hostname from the config before creating tarball output; below is an example...

```DEST="$BACKUPDIR/$(grep ^"set ns hostName" /tmp/nsbackup/ns.conf | awk '{print "ns-"$NF"__"}' | sed 's/__$/'" [$(echo $NS | cksum | awk '{print $1}')] $(date +%F)"'.tar.xv/')"```

Just like the previous script, this can ran automatically from cron...

```@weekly [ -f /srv/nsbackup/nsbackup.sh ] && { /srv/nsbackup/nsbackup.sh; } > /dev/null```

Feel free to review, modify or use this script however you see fit. Remember you do so at your own risk!
