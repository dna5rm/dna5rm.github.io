The following is a 2x Orange Pi Zero case I designed in Inkscape and cut out in acrylic on my laser cutter... I have been incorporating a lot of single-board arm systems, like the Raspberry Pi, in my projects lately. Among one of my favorite boards to play with is the Orange Pi; due to its price, hardware design and power. I assisting some developers with one of their projects and wanted 2 headless systems. My solution was to get 2 [Orange Pi Zero’s](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/New-Orange-Pi-Zero-H2-Quad-Core-Open-source-512MB-development-board-beyond-Raspberry-Pi/32761500374.html) and set them up running [armbian](https://www.armbian.com/). Since a lot of people were handling the systems, I created a custom case to both protect and show off the systems.
